# Resume #
My resume written in html.

## Motivation ##
I was motivated to created my resume in HTML by various blog posts some of the highlights being:
1) A resume is the first thing managers and peers in the software engineering field see when considering a candidate, so why not create and manage it using the same tools that would be used on the job.
2) Your resume is stored along side any open source projects, which allows any managers to cross reference any personal projects or open source contributions to your resume.
3) You get all of the benefits of branch and merging so that you always know what resume is up to date.

## Future Enhancements ##
1) Automatically convert the html to a pdf and publish to the github releases page on pushes to master
